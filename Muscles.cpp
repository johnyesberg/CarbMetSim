    // we assume that all exercise is aerobic exercise.
    
    //Frayn: The major fuels used in aerobic exercise vary with the intensity of the exercise and
    //with the duration. In relatively light exercise most of the energy required comes from
    //non-esterified fatty acids delivered from adipose tissue. At higher intensities, carbohydrate
    //tends to predominate early on, fat becoming more important later as glycogen
    //stores are depleted. As we have seen several times, the amount of glucose present in
    //the circulation and the extracellular fluid is small, and cannot be depleted without
    //harmful effects. Therefore, the carbohydrate used during endurance exercise comes
    //from glycogen stores, both in exercising skeletal muscle and in the liver. In principle,
    //it might also come from gluconeogenesis: exercising muscles always produce some
    //lactic acid, even in aerobic exercise, and this should be a good substrate for hepatic
    //  gluconeogenesis. The use of different fuels at
    // different intensities of exercise is illustrated in Figure 9.9.
    
    //Fig 9.9: For high intensity exercise, about 10% of energy required comes from plasma glucose
    // and 30% comes from muscle glycogen. (Abt 40% comes from plasma NEFA and remaining from muscle
    // Tg). For low intensity exercise, abt 10% energy comes from plasma glucose and remaining mostly
    //from plasma NEFA (some comes from muscle Tg).
    
    //Absorb glucose via GLUT4 when the insulin concentration is high and/or when the person is 
    //exercising. The absorbed glucose is oxidized or used for glycogen synthesis (if the person is not
    // exercising) or glycolysis (if the person is doing anaerobic exercising) to form lactate.
    
    //the glycolysis in muscles (to form lactate) takes place
    //at a basal rate (which causes the lactate concentration in blood of roughly 1mmol/l) . For light 
    //exercise, the lactate concentration (and hence the glycolysis flux) does not increase. But as the 
    //intensity of the exercise increases further, the lactate concentration increases, presumably 
    //because glycolysis flux increases. At peak exercise intensity, the lactate concentration can be as high 
    //as 9mmol/l.
    
    //oxidation of 1 g of carbs yields 4kcal of energy
    // molecular mass of glucose is 180.1559 g/mol
    // During glycolysis, 1 molecule of glucose results in 2 molecules of pyruvate (and hence 2 molecules
    // of lactate). So 1mmol/l of lactate corresponds to 0.5mmol/l of glucose. We assume that this is basal 
    //level of glycolysis. We assume that the level of glycolysis increases linearly with the exercise intensity
    // peaking to 9mmol/l of lactate production (equivalent to 4.5mmol/l of glucose consumption) when exercise 
    //intensity is 18 METs (marathon).
    
    //Assuming that there is 5l of blood in human body, 0.5mmol/l of glucose translates to 0.5*5*180.1559mg = 450mg
    // and 4.5mmol/l of glucose translates to 4053mg of glucose.
    
    //We need to play with glycolysis and gluconeogenesis numbers so that we achieve these balances for
    // lactate concentration. Here we assume that the glcolysis flux increases linearly with exercise intensity.
    
    //Gerich paper says that 2.22 micromol (per kg per minute) of glucose is consumed by muscles in post-absorptive state
    // (the number is abt 20 micromol per kg per minute in post-prandial state (insulin dependent number)). 
    //For now, we will assume that all this glucose is consumed via glycolysis.
    //20 micromol per kg per minute is 20*180.1559/1000 mg = 3.603 mg.
